Multithreading - allows multiple things to do at once. ex. google docs where multiple users are making changes at the same time on the same document. ex. watching youtube video, adding a comment etc.
Concurrency - while booking ticket no double booking should happeen when multiple users are booking at the same time. Python and node does not have built in concurrency. But cpp , java, go have concurrency.
Go is multi threaded , concurrent programming language.

We can use this for:
- building performant applications
- for building distributed applications
- simple and readable syntax
- efficieny and safety
- Go is used on server side - web applications, database services, microservices
- it is compiled language and its binary can be run on multiple paltforms.
- automation and cli based applications.


We need go compiler for executing.


================================

File structure of go file.

after creating a go file , initialze the go file with the command `go mod init <name-of-application/folder>`
everything in go is organized through packages. Even when we create own application we need to define it in package.
`package main`.
To do declaration : it is like an entry point of our application , we need our main starting point of execution.
*A program can have only 1 'main function' as only one entrypoint is possible.*
'we have to import the pckages in go implicitly.'
